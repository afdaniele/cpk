# `cpk` - Code Packaging toolKit 

**cpk** is a toolkit that standardizes the way code in a 
project is structured and packaged for maximum portability, 
readability, and maintainability.


## Get started
**cpk** provides a single CLI command, called `cpk`.

### A `cpk` Project
A cpk project is nothing more that a directory with a file
called `project.cpk` in it.

A few examples of cpk projects are provided in the `examples`
directory.


### Build
A cpk project can be built using the command,

```shell
cpk build
```


### Run
A cpk project can be run using the command,

```shell
cpk run
```
